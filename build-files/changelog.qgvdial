  * The main qgvdial code no longer uses webkit to log in or make calls or anything. There's now a coalasced API class that uses QNAM classes for HTTP GET and POST.
  * This class is capable of multiple simultaneous requests - it does not serialize access to Google Voice.
  * It should pave the way for a cleaner and more robust application.
  * No more webkit in qgvdial
